REST API Version History
========================

This documents the changes made to the REST API with every
microversion change. The description for each version should be a
verbose one which has enough information to be suitable for use in
user documentation.

2.1
---

  This is the initial version of the v2.1 API which supports
  microversions. The V2.1 API is from the REST API users's point of
  view exactly the same as v2.0 except with strong input validation.

  A user can specify a header in the API request::

    X-OpenStack-Nova-API-Version: <version>

  where ``<version>`` is any valid api version for this API.

  If no version is specified then the API will behave as if a version
  request of v2.1 was requested.

2.2
---

  Added Keypair type.

  A user can request the creation of a certain 'type' of keypair (``ssh`` or ``x509``)
  in the ``os-keypairs`` plugin

  If no keypair type is specified, then the default ``ssh`` type of keypair is
  created.

  Fixes status code for ``os-keypairs`` create method from 200 to 201

  Fixes status code for ``os-keypairs`` delete method from 202 to 204

2.3
---

  Exposed additional attributes in ``os-extended-server-attributes``:
  ``reservation_id``, ``launch_index``, ``ramdisk_id``, ``kernel_id``, ``hostname``,
  ``root_device_name``, ``userdata``.

  Exposed ``delete_on_termination`` for ``attached_volumes`` in ``os-extended-volumes``.

  This change is required for the extraction of EC2 API into a standalone
  service. It exposes necessary properties absent in public nova APIs yet.
  Add info for Standalone EC2 API to cut access to Nova DB.

2.4
---

  Show the ``reserved`` status on a ``FixedIP`` object in the ``os-fixed-ips`` API
  extension. The extension allows one to ``reserve`` and ``unreserve`` a fixed IP
  but the show method does not report the current status.

2.5
---

  Before version 2.5, the command ``nova list --ip6 xxx`` returns all servers
  for non-admins, as the filter option is silently discarded. There is no
  reason to treat ip6 different from ip, though, so we just add this
  option to the allowed list.

2.6
---

  A new API for getting remote console is added::

    POST /servers/<uuid>/remote-consoles
    {
      "remote_console": {
        "protocol": ["vnc"|"rdp"|"serial"|"spice"],
        "type": ["novnc"|"xpvnc"|"rdp-html5"|"spice-html5"|"serial"]
      }
    }

  Example response::

    {
      "remote_console": {
        "protocol": "vnc",
        "type": "novnc",
        "url": "http://example.com:6080/vnc_auto.html?token=XYZ"
      }
    }

  The old APIs 'os-getVNCConsole', 'os-getSPICEConsole', 'os-getSerialConsole'
  and 'os-getRDPConsole' are removed.

2.7
---

  A ``total_vms`` field is added in ``os-hypervisors`` related api. 
  ``running_vms`` and ``total_vms`` field exist in the response.
